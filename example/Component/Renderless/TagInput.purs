-- ACTIONS

-- This basic tag input will handle text input in a text field, key presses like "Enter", and
-- will update with new input when its parent re-renders. These are considered internal logic
-- for the component, in contrast with the Query type below, which is the component's public
-- interface.
type Action ps m v = Variant 
  ( handleInput :: String 
  , handleKey :: KE.KeyboardEvent
  , receive :: Input ps m v
  | v
  )

-- For convenience, we'll make it possible to use each of these actions just as you ordinarily would
-- use a data constructor. Where you would previously do \_ -> HandleInput you can now do
-- \_ -> handleInput. But the upside is that this is now extensible.

handleInput :: forall ps m v. String -> Action ps m v
handleInput = inj (SProxy :: _ "handleInput")

handleKey :: forall ps m v. KE.KeyboardEvent -> Action ps m v
handleKey = inj (SProxy :: _ "handleKey")

receive :: forall ps m v. Input ps m v -> Action ps m v
receive = inj (SProxy :: _ "receive")

-- For convenience, we'll provide a helper function which can be used on an input field's props in a 
-- render function to attach several actions at once. End users can essentially ignore how to wire
-- everything up and just use this function on the text input the user will interact with.

  :: forall ps m v

  -> Array (HH.IProp HTMLinput (Action ps m v)) 
  -> Array (HH.IProp HTMLinput (Action ps m v))

  [ HP.value st.text
  , HE.onValueInput $ pure <<< handleInput
  , HE.onKeyDown $ pure <<< handleKey
  ]

-- QUERY

-- This query type is a public interface to the component, which can be triggered by a parent
-- component at any time. We'll support imperatively selecting a tag, but we'll also support
-- two behaviors that make this useful as a renderless component: sending queries through and
-- performing an action provided by the parent component.
--
-- Notably, the public interface is not extensible. If you need to extend the public interface
-- with some new behavior you'd like to trigger from the parent, try providing it as an action and
-- then using `Perform`. If it also needs to return information, try providing an action that raises
-- a custom message and extending the `Message` type as well.

data Query ps v a
  = SelectTag String a
  -- A renderless component can be provided with further child components, mounted via the render
  -- function provided to the component. When those child components have public interfaces that 
  -- you would like to be accessible from the renderless component's parent, then you can allow
  -- direct access to the child query algebra from the parent while 'skipping' the renderless 
  -- component altogether. It's as if there were no renderless component. 
  | SendQuery (ChildQueryBox ps (Maybe a)) 
  -- The `Action` type of a renderless component is kept private. Sometimes, though, it's convenient 
  -- to extend a renderless component with new actions, some of which you'd like to be able to 
  -- imperatively trigger from a parent component. The `Perform` query allows you to do this by
  -- providing access to any actions you extended the renderless component with. It does not allow
  -- access to any private actions for the renderless component.
  | Perform (Variant v) a


-----
-- MESSAGE

-- Messages are the outputs of the component, which parent components can subscribe to and handle.
-- We'll use Variant once again to handle this.

-- This component will emit messages when a tag has been added to the list. We'll do something silly:
-- we'll notify end users about the index of the tag, not its contents. This gives us an excuse to 
-- work around the bad design later and show off a little more Renderless.
type Message out = Variant
  ( tagAdded :: Int
  | out 
  )

tagAdded :: forall out. Int -> Message out
tagAdded = inj (SProxy :: _ "tagAdded")


-----
-- SLOT

-- This convenience type synonym makes it a little nicer to provide this slot in a row to the
-- parent component.
type Slot ps out v
  = H.Slot (Query ps v) (Message out)


-----
-- COMPONENT TYPES

-- Renderless components use the Store comonad to hold on to their state and render functions. This
-- is critical because it allows the render function to be passed via the `Input` type and to be 
-- refreshed with the `receive` lifecycle method for the component. If you just pass the render 
-- function as an argument, then it will retain whatever values it had from the parent component at
-- the time the component was mounted. When the parent's state values change, the child will not
-- update accordingly. Passing via `Input` fixes this problem. TODO: This needs a _way_ better
-- explanation.
type StateStore ps m v =
  Store State (H.ComponentHTML (Action ps m v) ps m)

-- This component will maintain an array of tags and the current text in the text input.
type State = 
  { tags :: Array String 
  , text :: String 
  }

-- The render function must be provided via `input` if it is to contain any information from the
-- parent state; otherwise, the render function will remain with its initial values from the parent
-- for the duration of the component's life. This requires a newtype to accommodate the cyclical
-- reference to the Action variant type.
newtype Input ps m v = Input
  { render :: State -> H.ComponentHTML (Action ps m v) ps m 
  }

derive instance newtypeInput :: Newtype (Input ps m v) _

-- The component is, in most respects, a usual one. The main two differences: the render function 
-- is the `extract` function from the Store comonad, and it accepts a function as an argument that
-- instructs the component how to handle any new actions provided by a parent component.

-- ignore the renderless component standing between it and the component it wants to interact with.
